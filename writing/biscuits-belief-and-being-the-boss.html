        <h1>Biscuits, Belief, and Being the Boss: Leaderships lessons I Didn’t Expect to Learn</h1>
      </header>

      <section class="article-body">
        <p>Ted Lasso is an Apple TV series about an American football coach who moves to the United Kingdom to coach soccer, or rather, fútbol. He is cheerful, curious, and underestimated. What makes him stand out is his belief in people. He leads not by control or expertise, but through empathy, optimism, and small acts of kindness. As Ted says, “Be curious, not judgmental.” That line stuck with me. In many ways, curiosity is what leadership is built on. It means being willing to ask questions, to listen, and to see the person behind the performance.</p>

        <p>As a young professional, I have learned this lesson many times over. In leading teams of people older than me, supervising student employees as we all figured out life, and working with experienced professionals while still finding my footing, I learned that effective leadership is about understanding those around you and growing with them. Balancing confidence with humility, like Ted without the right playbook, I discovered the core lesson: leadership is not about having all the answers, but about learning through listening and sometimes failing.</p>

        <p>One of the first places I truly saw this in action was at the Collaboration on Quality in the Space and Defense Industries conference, hosted by the American Society for Quality. I had been invited to speak as a panelist for the Young Quality Professionals Board, representing the new generation entering the workforce. I remember walking into a room full of aerospace engineers, defense analysts, and technical managers with decades of experience. They were curious why someone my age was there. When I explained my background in accounting, policy, and data analytics, many nodded politely but seemed unsure how it all connected.</p>

        <p>As the discussions unfolded, something interesting happened. The professionals started talking about their challenges and how difficult it had become to connect with younger hires. They spoke about the frustration of seeing new employees leave quickly, the struggle to motivate them, and the growing communication gap between generations. I understood where they were coming from, but I saw it through a different lens. Growing up in a small, working-class Mississippi community, I saw people work hard for everything they had. For me, showing up, adapting, and doing your best was part of everyday life. I realized that the difference between my perspective and theirs was not about values, but about understanding. They were passionate about their work, just as I was, but we expressed it differently. That experience showed me that leadership often means translating perspectives so everyone feels heard and valued.</p>

        <p>The following year, I experienced exactly what they were describing. In August 2024, I became a Graduate Assistant for the University of Mississippi’s Campus Recreation, overseeing the Aquatics program. My role involved supervising lifeguards and instructors, managing Red Cross certification courses, ensuring compliance, tracking finances, and handling payroll, all while working on my own graduate coursework. I expected it to be busy but manageable. Instead, it turned into one of the hardest and most eye-opening experiences I have ever had.</p>

        <p>At first, I approached the role the way I always had: stay organized, hold high standards, and lead by example. But reality rarely matches expectations. Staff missed shifts, forgot deadlines, or arrived late. I found myself frustrated and confused about why others did not share my same drive. I stayed up late fixing payroll issues, rewriting schedules, and trying to make everything run smoothly. I wanted to be a strong leader, but often felt stuck in the middle, responsible for both my staff’s growth and my own academic success.</p>

        <p>It was during this time that I started to understand another one of Ted’s sayings: “Taking on a challenge is a lot like riding a horse. If you are comfortable while you are doing it, you are probably doing it wrong.” I was definitely uncomfortable. There were moments when nothing seemed to go right. Some staff members saw me as too strict, while others relied on me too much. I struggled to find a balance between empathy and accountability. Looking back, I see how similar my frustration was to what those professionals at the conference described. I wanted my staff to understand how much I was juggling, and they wanted me to understand the challenges they were facing outside of work. We were all trying to succeed, but in different ways.</p>

        <p>It took time for me to slow down and really listen. I began asking questions instead of making assumptions. Many of my staff were balancing full course loads, multiple jobs, or family responsibilities. Once I learned their situations, I began communicating differently. I adjusted schedules when possible, clarified expectations, and made it a point to check in more often. I also started holding myself accountable for delivering feedback. These small changes built trust and created a stronger team dynamic.</p>

        <p>The more I listened, the more the frustration faded. My staff began to take more ownership of their roles. I learned how to guide instead of manage. The conversations that used to be tense became collaborative. By the end of my time as a Graduate Assistant, our team had grown into a community. We respected and supported one another. The same students who once tested boundaries were now helping new employees succeed.</p>

        <p>When I reflect on that experience, it reminds me of the final season of Ted Lasso. The team that once resisted Ted’s coaching eventually understood that belief is not about winning every game. It is about showing up for each other. My own team found that same rhythm. We were no longer just employees working shifts, but people who genuinely cared about the group’s success.</p>

        <p>The truth is that leadership is not always comfortable or simple. It is often tiring and uncertain, but growth happens there. Whether you are managing a team, applying for your first job, or trying to make an impact, empathy connects effort to meaning. As Ted Lasso said, “Be curious, not judgmental.” Curiosity about people, their stories, and their challenges builds understanding. Understanding turns a group of individuals into a real team. Sometimes leadership looks like long days, tough conversations, and uncomfortable lessons. Other times, it looks like offering grace, building trust, and believing in people before they believe in themselves. And sometimes, it looks like baking the biscuits and showing up anyway. But no matter the form it takes, true leadership is about showing up with empathy, curiosity, and the belief that growth, both personal and collective, comes from stepping into the discomfort and making a difference together.</p>
