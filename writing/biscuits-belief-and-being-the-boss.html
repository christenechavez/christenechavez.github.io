        <p>Ted Lasso is an Apple TV series about an American football coach who moves to the United Kingdom to coach soccer, or rather, fútbol. As he takes on this unfamiliar role, he faces not only his own challenges but also the unique struggles of the people around him. If I have learned anything from watching Ted Lasso, it is that leadership is rarely about being the smartest person in the room. It is about listening, learning, and sometimes baking biscuits for people who do not even know they need them.</p>

        <p>As a young professional, I have found myself leading teams of people older than me, guiding student staff who were figuring life out just like I was, and sitting at conference tables with engineers who could literally launch rockets while I was still trying to remember where I parked. Each of those moments taught me something valuable about what it truly means to lead with empathy, adaptability, and accountability.</p>

        <p>The American Society for Quality is an organization filled with professionals from many industries who are committed to improving the quality of their work. In 2023, a professional from KBR in the space and defense sector heard me describing my internship at Crowe LLP, which unexpectedly led to an invitation to speak as a panelist for the Young Quality Professionals Board at the annual Collaboration on Quality in the Space and Defense Industries conference.</p>

        <p>When I arrived at the conference the following year, I was surrounded by people with decades of technical experience, while I represented the new generation entering the workforce. These individuals were designing rockets and missiles, while I was still learning how to write financial statements. Instead of pretending to have all the answers, I chose to listen. What I heard were frustrations about retention, motivation, and communication when hiring young professionals. When I finally spoke, I realized my role was not to compete with their expertise but to bridge understanding. I wanted to show that young professionals care deeply about purpose, culture, and being seen as more than just a number.</p>

        <p>At that time, I was balancing two jobs while earning two degrees, determined to prove myself through hard work and reliability. However, a year later, I stepped into a role that challenged everything I thought I knew about leadership.</p>

        <p>In August 2024, I became a Graduate Assistant for the University of Mississippi’s Campus Recreation, specifically in the Aquatics program. I oversaw lifeguards and swim instructors, managed Red Cross courses, ensured compliance with both university and Red Cross policies, handled payroll, tracked financial data, and developed programs to improve the department. What I assumed would be the most straightforward and enjoyable part of my job, supervising, turned out to be the most demanding.</p>

        <p>I quickly learned that leadership sometimes looks like explaining for the tenth time why showing up on time matters, or covering a shift because someone forgot to check the schedule, all while finishing your own project before midnight and submitting payroll on time. It taught me patience, communication, and the difference between being a boss and being a mentor. As Ted says, “Taking on a challenge is a lot like riding a horse. If you are comfortable while you are doing it, you are probably doing it wrong.”</p>

        <p>Transitioning from the conference environment, where I was surrounded by career focused professionals, to managing a team of students with different priorities was humbling. Many of my staff faced personal challenges I had never experienced, such as balancing work, classes, and family obligations, which made it difficult to stay consistent. Over time, I began to understand that leadership is not about expecting everyone to think or work like me. It is about learning to meet people where they are.</p>

        <p>In this role, I had to learn how to communicate with empathy while also helping others recognize that I, too, had responsibilities and pressures outside of work. The real progress happened when both sides understood that we were all trying to succeed, just in different ways. Some of my staff valued structure, while others needed flexibility, but every one of them wanted to feel supported and respected. Once I began to understand those differences, everything changed. Frustration turned into collaboration, and accountability became mutual respect. By the end of my role as a Graduate Assistant, it felt much like the final episode of Ted Lasso. The people I once struggled to reach began to understand my expectations, and I learned to understand their needs. Together, we found balance and shared growth.</p>

        <p>The truth is that we all want to feel that what we do matters. Whether you are managing a team, applying for your first job, or running an entire company, empathy is what connects effort to impact. Ted Lasso said it best, “Be curious, not judgmental.” If I have learned anything so far, it is that curiosity about people, their stories, and how we can support each other better is what makes any team stronger.</p>
