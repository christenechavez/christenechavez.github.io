      <section class="article-body">
        <p>When I started college, most of my early work experience came from jobs in politics. I loved understanding how policy shapes people’s lives. I also realized that finance is the backbone of every decision, program, and promise. That realization led me to earn two bachelor’s degrees in public policy leadership and accounting at the University of Mississippi. One taught me how to think about impact. The other taught me how to measure it. What I did not realize then was how those two worlds would merge perfectly in one role: managing grants for a small town in Mississippi. There, every dollar must stretch, every chart tells a story, and every visualization can help bring real change.</p>

        <p>When I first started college, I mapped out my entire course schedule. Only one class, Public Policy Grant Writing, mentioned grants, and neither program addressed the financial side. This gap left accounting students without grant compliance experience and policy students without financial accountability exposure. Ironically, my first accounting job after graduation involved reviewing grant compliance for a large client, which finally bridged both disciplines in practice.</p>

        <p>A year later, I found myself out of college and unemployed. That changed when a close friend told me about a small town in Mississippi, just outside of Tunica County, that desperately needed help finding funding. A week later, I was driving there. It looked like the kind of southern town most people picture when they imagine rural Mississippi. There was one main street, a few small businesses, and friendly faces who all seemed to know one another. Almost everyone I met had grown up there. At one time, the town had been busier, with a railroad running through it that brought jobs and visitors. When the railroad slowed, so did the economy. Now there were potholes in the roads, buildings without central air conditioning, and limited resources for nearly everything else.</p>

        <p>When I sat down with the town’s leaders, they shared their vision and the challenges they faced. The town needed help rebuilding infrastructure, improving safety, and supporting residents. But the budget was extremely limited. Matching funds for grants were nonexistent. Searching for grants without cost-matching requirements felt like trying to find Americans who prefer British tea; possible, but rare. I quickly realized that to make this town’s needs stand out, I had to let the data tell the story.</p>

        <p>During my first few grant applications, I began creating data visualizations to advocate for funding. One project involved a grant focused on justice system support. I worked with the police department’s clerk to build a dashboard. It showed the correlation between individuals pulled over each month for not having a driver’s license and those unable to pay their citations. When I layered in income data and transportation access, the results were eye-opening. The visualization showed how financial hardship led not only to unpaid tickets but also to barriers in obtaining driver’s licenses. This created a cycle that affected both residents and the town’s operations. This data story became the foundation for a proposal. We aimed to fund a program that would bring instructors to the community to help residents study for and earn their licenses.</p>

        <p>Creating this visualization taught me how impactful clear, accessible data can be. It was not about using complex visuals or adding unnecessary detail. Instead, I focused on something simple, accurate, and human. With this approach, decision-makers could immediately understand the problem and the solution.</p>

        <p>Working in a small town has shown me that data analytics is not only about precision but also about empathy. Every visualization I create represents real people, real needs, and real opportunities for change. Whether I am building dashboards or budgets, my goal remains the same: to make data clear enough to drive progress. The lessons I have learned from merging public policy and accounting continue to guide me in turning information into impact, one grant, one chart, and one community at a time. Through these challenges, I learned that true leadership means not just providing technical solutions, but helping people see and understand the path forward, even when resources are scarce.</p>
