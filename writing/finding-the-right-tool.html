        <h1>Finding the Right Tool</h1>
        <p class="byline">A breakdown of data software I have used</p>
      </header>

      <section class="article-body">
        <p>Have you ever wondered which data platform is best suited for a specific project? Or maybe you have been curious about what each tool can really do beyond the marketing buzzwords. Below is my personal breakdown of several popular applications I have worked with, including what they do well and where they can be challenging.</p>

        <h2>Alteryx</h2>
        <p>Alteryx offers a wide range of drag and drop tools that let you process, clean, and transform data without needing to code. You can preview your data at every step, making troubleshooting much easier than on some other platforms. I prefer Alteryx for projects that involve multiple datasets or repeated workflows because it feels intuitive once you understand how the tool connections work.</p>
        <p>That said, it takes a little time to get used to how everything links together, and complex workflows can push your computer’s limits. Still, it is a strong middle ground between coding and visual data manipulation.</p>

        <h2>Azure AI Studio</h2>
        <p>AI Studio combines several tools on one dashboard to clean, convert, and merge datasets. It is especially useful when integrating artificial intelligence or machine learning functions into your workflow. However, it is also one of the more temperamental systems I have used.</p>
        <p>Sometimes connections fail without clear explanations, and splitting a workflow into multiple branches can be heavy on your computer. For someone with a deep background in coding and AI, this tool has great potential, but for most analysts, it can feel unnecessarily complex for routine cleaning or merging tasks.</p>

        <h2>Excel</h2>
        <p>Excel is the true definition of “if it is not broke, do not fix it.” Whether you are tracking a small event budget or analyzing thousands of data points, Excel offers nearly endless formulas, pivot tables, and visualization options. I appreciate how accessible it is and how quickly you can build analyses or visual dashboards.</p>
        <p>Its limitations are mostly around collaboration and accuracy. Only one person can edit a file at a time, and with so much manual entry, human error is a constant risk. For sensitive or large scale data, security and performance can also become concerns. Still, Excel’s versatility keeps it at the center of most analytics work.</p>

        <h2>Power BI</h2>
        <p>Power BI integrates seamlessly with Excel, Azure, and SQL Server, turning data into interactive dashboards and reports. It is user friendly for beginners and powerful for advanced users, especially when modeling data or connecting multiple sources.</p>
        <p>I enjoy how quickly you can turn spreadsheets into live visuals, and the community support makes it easy to troubleshoot. Customization can be limited without using DAX or coding, and running complex dashboards can slow performance. But overall, Power BI is one of the most practical tools for sharing analytics with a broader audience.</p>

        <h2>Python — Pandas and GitHub</h2>
        <p>Python’s flexibility makes it one of the most valuable skills for any analyst. Using Pandas, I have cleaned and built datasets directly from raw files, while GitHub has allowed me to store and share code, including for the very website hosting this blog.</p>
        <p>The learning curve can be steep, especially when debugging, since some systems do not clearly explain where an error occurs. It also takes time for long scripts to run because every line executes an action. Despite that, the control Python offers over your data and the ability to automate almost anything make it worth learning.</p>

        <h2>SAP</h2>
        <p>I used SAP through a class project, working with a simulated company to generate real time financial data. The system updates automatically as new entries are made, which makes collaboration easy and accurate. It also integrates well across departments, which is useful for larger organizations.</p>
        <p>The downside is the interface. The layout can feel intimidating at first, and users must know exactly where to find certain information. Once you learn the structure, though, it becomes an efficient tool for managing financial and operational data.</p>

        <h2>SQL Server</h2>
        <p>SQL Server is a foundational tool for data storage, management, and analysis. It integrates closely with Microsoft products, including Power BI and Azure, allowing smooth transitions between data warehousing and visualization.</p>
        <p>I have used it to query and transform structured data, which is ideal for large datasets that need precise filtering or relational analysis. The platform’s power lies in its efficiency and control, but it can appear overwhelming at first, especially for those without SQL syntax experience. Once you learn to write clear queries, however, it becomes one of the most reliable tools for clean, verifiable data management.</p>

        <h2>Tableau</h2>
        <p>Tableau is my favorite visualization platform. It makes data storytelling both creative and analytical. Whether you are building heat maps, charts, or full interactive dashboards, Tableau’s customization options are impressive. The story feature lets you combine visuals and text to guide viewers through insights, which is especially helpful for grant and policy presentations.</p>
        <p>It works best with clean datasets since missing or inconsistent values can create performance issues. Even so, Tableau’s balance between design freedom and analytical depth makes it one of the best tools for transforming data into action.</p>

        <h2>Workpapers — Clara</h2>
        <p>My first experience with Workpapers came through a KPMG tax simulation course using Clara. The platform stored client information and supported the preparation of corporate tax returns. While it was straightforward to navigate between reports and supporting schedules, hidden errors occasionally made the process challenging.</p>
        <p>Once identified, though, fixes were simple, and the interface allowed quick adjustments. The main drawback was the time it took for some functions to run and the need to constantly switch between screens. Still, it provided a valuable introduction to professional accounting technology and digital tax preparation.</p>

        <h2>Workpapers — Oracle</h2>
        <p>At Crowe LLP, I used Oracle’s version of Workpapers while working in risk and compliance. It stored client data, supported internal reviews, and allowed multiple users to collaborate on audit documentation.</p>
        <p>While the system’s layout differed slightly from Clara, the concept was similar, centralized organization of client work. Switching between the client portal and Oracle could be tedious, and multitasking often meant having several monitors open at once. Despite the clutter, the platform was efficient, well structured, and excellent for maintaining accuracy and transparency in audit work.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Each software system offers its own strengths and frustrations. The more I use them, the clearer it becomes that no single platform solves everything. The real value lies in knowing which one to use for which purpose, and how to connect them when needed. Whether visualizing data in Tableau, building a Power BI dashboard, or querying with SQL Server, the key is using these tools to turn information into understanding.</p>
